Link to live deployed app: https://spudsandduds.herokuapp.com/

# Concept
Having a place where you can share your thoughts on a movie is every movie buffs passion. With Spuds and Duds we wanted to create a community that does just that.

# Purpose
Spuds and Duds gives you the chance to select from a database of movies to review and post for other to see.
<br><br>
Our motivation for developing this app is to give a cinephile a community to share their opinions on movies and interact with others with the same passion. 
<br><br>
As a user, you will be able to search a movie that gives a small description and then be able to post, edit, or delete a review. you can also comment on other reviews that are posted on the feed.
